### Breast Cancer Tumor Subtype Assignment through Classification Model of aCGH Data

## Authors
- Jeren Olsen
- Ramon van Amerongen
- Aaron Lin
- Susana Lopez Lemarroy

## Main challenge: building a generalizable model using a small dataset (100 instances)
- Mutual information feature selection to reduce feature space
- Nested Cross validation scheme for model training & comparison
- XGBoost best performing model selected to make final predictions (72% accuracy overall, 100% prediction for HER2+ subclass)
- Most important features (biomaerkers) extracted from each model for biological relevance research
